                - 1. Get the Path for binaries
                    ```pwsh
                    cd C:/TDM-GCC-32/
                    ```
                    - Go to the "bin" directory
                    ```pwsh

                    ```

                    - copy this path
                - 2. Copy the path to PATH variable in the enviroment:
